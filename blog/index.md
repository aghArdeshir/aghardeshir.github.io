    - title: Merge Request Mastery
      description: This blog post is about making Merge Requests more reviewable and enhancing the quality and value of code reviews. A good merge request is essential because it allows more in-depth discussion about important parts and the result would be better code and better software. My goal in this blog post is to share what makes a good MR in my opinion.
