# Pull Request vs. Merge Request

<p class="subheading">Which one sounds better?</p>

In GitHub world people see and use the word "Pull Request" a lot. And in GitLab world, the same thing is called "Merge Requests". Why is it imporant, you may ask? Well, it is not that much important really as they do the same thing and the way you create them are also the same way. But I believe it makes us better software engineers if we think philosophically and deeply about what we are doing from time to time. 

To me, the argue is: when I create a branch out of a repository, later I submit a **request** for someone to **merge** it. I'm not really **request**ing them to **pull** it.
