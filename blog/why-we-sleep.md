# Why We Sleep (book by Matthew Walker)

Recently I finished reading a book called "Why We Sleep" by "Matthew Walker".

It was so good that I felt I had to share it in a blog post.

// TODO: Put a picture of the book here

The book first forms a question: "Why did evolution design sleep, while it does not seem to be beneficial: because you can't search for food while asleep and also it does not protect you from predators in case of attack." If that question makes you curious too, or if you think sleeping is a waste of time, or if you don't really feel awake & energetic during the day, if you sleep less than 7:30~8:30 hours a night, then I highly recommend this book to you. This book helps you (as it helped me) love the sleep and even get excited about it.

It will definitely save/change your life by some degree towards better (as it changed mine)

Here I list the most interesting topics you can learn about by reading this scientific book:
- How sleep differs in different animals (vs. human)
- How your sleep needs change while you grow up
- Why was sleep deprivation record banned from Guiness World Records book
- What is dreaming? Why we dream? Why do dreams feel weird?
- What is Lucid dreaming? Can science prove lucid dreaming?
- What are different stages of sleep (REM vs. NREM) and how do they affect your overal physical and mental health
- How dreaming helps with creativity
- Why some companies pay bonuses to their employees who sleep more (and why every company should start doing so for their own benefit)
- How coffe (caffeine in general) makes you "feel" more awake and alive (You will love your daily coffe less after learning about effects of it)
- connection of ADHD and sleep
- relation of Alzheimer's and sleep
- What is Circadian rhythm
- Why we hated so much to wake up early in the morning to go to school (And we were absolutely right about hating it). And what was the result of some schools experimenting with changing their start time to a later time
- Why we hate (and should keep hating) morning alarm clocks (this one made me think about when was the last time I woke up naturally as a result of sufficient/adequate sleep)
- How much sleep deprivation is equivalent to being legally drunk (And you are still allowed to drive legally while this much "drunk" and even more) and how much of car crashes relate to sleep deprivation
- Why and How different colors in light spectrum "tricks" our brain into thinking it is wake time or sleep time. Specifically why & how "blue light" at night harms your sleep
- Why do we have "night owls" and "morning larks" in society beside each other (this one was a very interesting evolutionary story)
- So many people claim they can predict your future based on your dreams! But can scientists actually predict your dreams by your waking life?
- Lots of interesting experiments done on humans and lab rats and spiders! And the findings.
- And a lots of cool tips about how you could optimize and benefit from your sleep


And these are only the interesting facts I remembered about. Definitely this book was loaded with science, interesting facts and thought-provoking ideas. It helped me a lot, I feel more awake, energetic, disciplined and focused after reading this book and I'm sure you'll do too.
