              working with here. Additionally, the product itself, Storyteq, is
              so interesting and challenging that gives me the urge to wake up
              and go to the office every weekday. This is a large-scale product
              with lots of important customers: Heineken, KFC, McDonald's, and
              BMW to name a few.

              This role was my first international job experience and the
              largest company size I've ever worked with. New things I learned
              here are large-scale project management and maintaining stable
              design/UI/UX across multiple products. And the challenge of
              software internationalization here was far more serious than the
              internationalization experiences I had before. Additionally using
              English as the primary language in the office significantly
              improved my language skills. Plus, Working on a Website Builder
              was one of the most interesting experiences in my career.

            <p>
              My role here was Full Stack Web-Application developer, Front-end
              weighted and later I got promoted to Frontend team lead after 1
              year. The main benefit of working at Faraz Pajohan was working
              with expert people and experiencing well-structured team
              management and project planning. This was my first time
              bootstrapping and completing a professional-grade Web Application
              from the ground up. I constantly applied best practices alongside
              developing features as the whole team was always encouraged
              against technical debts. Mentored an intern who successfully
              completed their training period under my guidance. New things I
              enjoyed learning and getting done here are extreme use of
              WebSockets for real-time data, designing customizable dashboards,
              running and managing child processes from NodeJS, and creating
              filterable, searchable, sortable, pageable SQL queries, and
              practicing Test Driven Development for frontend. As the rest of
              the team was building a customized OS forked from Debian, I was
              responsible for installing and running the web application on it.
              So I got to configure the NGINX, install InfluxDB, run the NodeJS
              app, and also serve the frontend SPA admin panel on that OS.

            I omitted two roles from this resume because I left after the
            probation period in both cases:
            <ul>
              <li>
                One role was at a large company that specialized in stock
                trading and investment platforms. I worked on a product for
                future exchanges. The reason I left was I did not see any growth
                opportunities there.
              </li>
              <li>
                The other one was a small company working on a management app
                with document-sharing features, a calendar, a to-do list, and
                more. It was built for 3 platforms: Web, Android, and Windows
                separately. I was working on the Web. Despite the previous one I
                was surrounded by really genius people here, and I learned a lot
                even in those short ~1.5 months. The problem though was the
                excessive working culture there. Working for 12 hours is OK if
                it happens from time to time, but do it every day and it starts
                harming your life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Both of these ~1.5 months experiences happened in 2019, between
            "Hasin" 👇 and "Faraz Pajohan" ☝.

              I began my professional full-time career here in Hasin as a

              challenging and complex product, called UbiProcess/Bizotop,
              alongside a very knowledgeable team. Our same web app codebase was
              ported to Android & iOS using Cordova. I learned material design
              basics here for the first time.

              Another one was a network packet classifier using C++ and CUDA. It

              Worked on various projects, mostly with WordPress and OpenCart. My

              HTML/CSS tweaks. We created various online shops and a handful of

              My most satisfying experience was on a headphone shop. They asked
              for a 3D preview of headphones, which we could not deliver, but
              instead, we brought every headphone in, one by one, took 30-40
              pictures of each, and created a 360° preview on the website. I
              used a JQuery plugin to accomplish this.

        <h2><img src="tools-wrench.svg" width="16" /> Tools & Skills</h2>

        <div class="tools-and-skills">
          <b>JavaScript</b>
          <small>
            Confident enough to know I can build everything I see with it.
          </small>

          <b>TypeScript</b>
          <small>
            I am comfortable with it. Never got deep with it. But never was also
            left hanging with it. I can make good use of utility types, type
            guards, and template types where necessary.
          </small>

          <b>DOM</b>
          <small>
            Know it and love it. I also love the challenge of re-implementing
            everything that modern frameworks and UI libraries can do with pure
            DOM.
          </small>

          <b>React</b>
          <small>
            Have 4 years of full-time employed experience with it. Had to know
            it deeply while working on a website builder
          </small>

          <b>Vue</b>
          <small>
            Had experience with it for more than 1 year. Got enough knowledge
            with it while migrating a complex project from Vue 2 to Vue 3. One
            that involved communicating our declarative state to an imperative
            canvas library!
          </small>

          <b>AngularJS</b>
          <small>
            Worked for 2 full years with it (but don't remember much now).
          </small>

          <b>Angular</b>
          <small>
            Not much experience. Only a few months of professional experience.
            Angular was the one that taught me TypeScript. However, after
            learning React and Vue, I always considered Angular as unnecessarily
            over-structuring the code-base. Sometimes we want quick and dirty
            while prototyping!
          </small>

          <b>React Native</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge! Just have bootstrapped two projects with it
            and abandoned them. Just enough to know the basic concepts of how it
            works.
          </small>

          <b>Node.js</b>
          <small>
            Fired up a few web backend projects with it, including one for
            production at Faraz Pajohan. Used Express, MySQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB,
            and Socket.IO with it.
          </small>

          <b>Express</b>
          <small>
            Not too advanced. Not too basic. Enough to launch a full RESTful API
            with enough complexity and still keep it clean!
          </small>

          <b>Frontend E2E testing</b>
          <small> I've Have done a few. With CyPress and Selenium. </small>

          <b>NGINX</b>
          <small>
            I've fired up a few random personal projects on Linux VPSs. And was
            a Full Stack developer for one year at Faraz Pajohan and I set up
            the web application there.
          </small>

          <b>Linux Administration</b>
          <small>
            Very very basic knowledge! But enough to be able to turn a
            fresh-installed Linux distro (does not matter what distro) into a
            working web server. And enough to find my way around problems by
            searching for them online. My top-notch noticeable experiences are
            building Ardour on my Ubuntu, and installing Arch Linux following
            its documentation.
          </small>

          <b>RegEx</b>
          <small>
            Once I realized I knew nothing about them and went to HackerRank and
            solved A LOT of challenges. Now I am most comfortable with it. The
            best feeling is when a colleague asks for help on a RegEx and I can
            help. 😎
          </small>

          <b>Git</b>
          <small>
            I love Git. I've used it almost everywhere I was (except for a few
            months on a project I used SVN). I've been on GitHub, GitLab,
            ButBucket, and just Git servers without a UI! I've worked in both
            "rebasing" and "merging" teams and also a manual-squash enforcing
            team. My top-notch experience is two times that I resurrected "lost"
            commits from a deleted branch using
            <code>git reflog</code>.
          </small>

          <b>MongoDB</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge. Always loved it because it was easy 👀
          </small>

          <b>SQL</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge. Just know the concepts and can find my way by
            searching.
          </small>

          <b>HTML</b>
          <small>YES!</small>

          <b>CSS</b>
          <small>
            I always accomplished what I wanted with it without knowing how!
            Happens rarely recently. (I mean the "without knowing how" part)
          </small>

          <b>C++</b>
          <small>
            I've built a very basic 2D move-and-shoot game with SFML, wrote a
            network packet classifier with CUDA, and modified a CGI web service
            written in C here and there.
          </small>

          <b>CUDA</b>
          <small>
            I know the concepts behind it, why and how this whole computing on
            GPU is cool, and implemented a network packet classifier with CUDA.

            I had a few experiences transforming legacy code into new code. I
            migrated 3 different projects from:
            <ul>
              <li>AngualarJS/JavaScript -> Angular/TypeScript</li>
              <li>ExtJS -> React/MaterialUI -> TypeScript</li>
              <li>Vue.js 2/Nuxt 2 -> Vue.js 3/Nuxt 3</li>
            </ul>
            So I can say I can find my way in legacy code, deep dive in, and
            come out with a better code.
