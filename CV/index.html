              This is my first abroad job experience and the largest company
              size I've ever been to. The new things I learned here are huge
              project management using Lerna and how we had to keep the
              design/UI/UX stable across multiple products of the same company.
              And the challenge and strictness of the product's multilingualism
              here were far more serious than the internationalization
              experiences I had before. And also speaking English in the office
              was one of the best self-improvement skills I gained here. Plus,
              It is the most interesting product I've ever got to work on: A
              Website Builder!

              My main role here is Web-Application development, Front-end
              weighted. The main benefit of working at Faraz Pajohan is the
              expert people I get to work with and how teams are structured and
              managed & projects are planned. My best teamwork experience so far
              happened here and this is my first time bootstrapping and
              completing a professional-grade Web-Application from the ground
              up. Here I have the authority to devote time to applying best
              practices alongside developing features. So I get to contribute to
              different libraries we use and in the team, we pick tasks for
              cleaning up code and paying the technical debts periodically. What
              I am working on here is a Configuration Manager for a specific
              device. New things I enjoyed learning and getting done here are
              extreme use of WebSockets for real-time data, designing
              customizable dashboards, running and managing child processes from
              NodeJS, and running filterable/searchable/sortable/pageable SQL

            <p>
              Worked on various projects, mostly WordPress, and OpenCart. I
              mostly fixed PHP & JS Issues there + some HTML/CSS tweaks. I
              remember we created various online shops there and a couple
              websites for local businesses in Hamedan. Most satisfying
              experience I remember was this headphone shop, who asked us for a
              3D preview of headphones, which we could not create of course! But
              instead, we brought every headphone in, one by one, took pictures
              of it, and created a 360Â° preview on the website for which user
              could drag the mouse and rotate the headphone. We took ~30-40
              pictures of every headphone to show it most smooth while rotating.
              And I used a JQuery plugin to acoopmlish this for which I don't
              remember the name now.

          * There were two other jobs removed from here, because for both of
          them, I joined for the probabation period and left afterwards. One was
          a big one specialized in stock, trading and investment platforms and I
          worked on a product for future exchanges. The reason I left after the
          probabation period was lack of knowledgable people there (despite the
          company size, for which I met >50 developers everyday!). I did not see
          any potential for growth. The other one was a small company working on
          a manager app (docs + calendar + TODO list + etc...) and it was
          working on 3 native platforms: Web, Android and Windows. I was working
          on the Web. Despite the previous one I was surrounded by really genius
          people here, and I learned a lot even in those short ~1.5 months. The
          problem though was the excessive working culture there. Working for 12
          hours is OK and happens from time to time, but do it everyday and it
          starts harming your life. Both of these ~1.5 months experiences
          happened in 2019, between "Hasin" and "Faraz Pajohan".
