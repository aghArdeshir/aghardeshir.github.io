              This role was my first international job experience and the
              largest company size I've ever worked with. New things I learned
              here are large-scale project management and maintaining
              design/UI/UX stable across multiple products. And the challenge
              and strictness of the product's multilingualism here were far more
              serious than the internationalization experiences I had before.
              Additionally using English as the primary language in the office
              significantly improved my language skills. Plus, working on w
              Website Builder was one of the most interesting experiences in my
              career.

              My role here was Full Stack Web-Application development, Front-end
              weighted. The main benefit of working at Faraz Pajohan was working
              with expert people and experiencing well-structured team
              management and project planning. This was my first time
              bootstrapping and completing a professional-grade Web-Application
              from the ground up. I constantly applied best practices alongside
              developing features as the whole team always encouraged agains
              technical debts. New things I enjoyed learning and getting done
              here are extreme use of WebSockets for real-time data, designing
              customizable dashboards, running and managing child processes from
              NodeJS, and running filterable, searchable, sortable, pageable SQL
              queries, and practicing Test Driven Development for frontend. As
              the rest of the team were building a customized OS forked from
              Debian, I was responsible for installing and running the web
              application on it. So I got to config the NGINX, install InfluxDB,
              and run the NodeJS app and also serve the frontend SPA.

            I ommitted two roles from this resume, because for both of them, I
            left after the probation period:
            <ul>
              <li>
                One rloe was at a large company specialized in stock trading and
                investment platforms. I worked on a product for future
                exchanges. The reason I left was I did not see any opportunities
                for growth there.
              </li>
              <li>
                The other one was a small company working on a management app
                with document sharing features, calendar, to-do list, and more.
                It was built for 3 platforms: Web, Android and Windows
                separately. I was working on the Web. Despite the previous one I
                was surrounded by really genius people here, and I learned a lot
                even in those short ~1.5 months. The problem though was the
                excessive working culture there. Working for 12 hours is OK if
                it happens from time to time, but do it everyday and it starts
                harming your life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Both of these ~1.5 months experiences happened in 2019, between
            "Hasin" and "Faraz Pajohan".

              I began my professional full-time career here in Hasin as a
              Frontend developer. I had the opportunity of working on a very
              challenging and complex product, called UbiProcess/Bizotop,
              alongside a very knowledgable team. Our same web-app codebase was
              ported to Android & iOS using Cordova. I learned material design
              basics here for the first time.

              And another one was a network packet classifier using C++ and

              internet routers with CUDA could help us with classifying internet
              packets in real-time.

              Worked on various projects, mostly with WordPress and OpenCart. My
              responsibilites were fixing PHP and JavaScript issues and some
              HTML/CSS tweaks. We created various online shops and a handful of
              websites for local businesses in Hamedan with eye-catching landing

              My most satisfying experience was on a headphone shop. They asked
              for a 3D preview of headphones, which we could not deliver, but
              instead, we brought every headphone in, one by one, took 30-40
              pictures of each, and created a 360Â° preview on the website. I
              used a JQuery plugin to accopmlish this.

        <h2><img src="tools-wrench.svg" width="16" /> Tools & Skills</h2>

        <div class="tools-and-skills">
          <b>JavaScript</b>
          <small>
            Confident enough to know I can build eveything I see with it
          </small>

          <b>DOM</b>
          <small>
            Know it and love it. I also love the challenge of re-implementing
            everythings that modern frameworks and UI libraries can do with pure
            DOM.
          </small>

          <b>React</b>
          <small>
            Have 4 years of full-time employed experience with it, and got
            pretty deep while working on a website builder
          </small>

          <b>Vue</b>
          <small>
            Had experience with it fro more than 1 year. Got enough knowledge
            with it while migrating a really complex project from Vue 2 to VUe
            3. One that involved communicating our declarative state to an
            imperative canvas library!
          </small>

          <b>AngularJS</b>
          <small>
            Worked for 2 full years with it, but don't remember much now.
            Specially it was the first years of my career. I did not look at
            things so much deep and conceptually back then.
          </small>

          <b>Angular</b>
          <small>
            Not much experience. Only a few months of professional experience.
            Angular was the one that taught me TypeScript. But after learning
            React and Vue, I always considered Angular as forcing us to
            over-structure the code-base. Sometimes we want quick and dirty
            while prototyping!
          </small>

          <b>Frontend E2E testing</b>
          <small> Have done a few. With CyPress and Selenium. </small>

          <b>NGINX</b>
          <small>
            I've fired up a few random personal projects on Linux VPSs. And were
            a full stack developer for one year at Faraz Pajohan and I set up
            the web application there.
          </small>

          <b>Linux Administration</b>
          <small>
            Very very basic knowledge! But enough to be able to turn a
            fresh-installed linux distro (does not matter what distro much) into
            a working web server. And enough to find my way around problems by
            searching for them online. My top-notch noticable experiences are
            building Ardour on my Ubuntu, and installing Arch linux following
            its documentation.
          </small>

          <b>RegEx</b>
          <small>
            Once I realized I know nothing about them, and went to HackerRank
            and solved A LOT of challenges. Now I am most comfortable with it.
            The best feeling is when a colleauge asks for help about it and I am
            able to help. ðŸ˜Ž
          </small>

          <b>Git</b>
          <small>
            I love Git. And I've used it almost everywhere I was (except a few
            months on a project I used SVN). I've been on GitHub, GitLab,
            ButBucket, and just Git servers! I do "rebase" instead of "merge"
            and I squash when necessary. I even resurrected "lost" work using
            <code>git reflog</code>.
          </small>

          <b>React Native</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge! Just have bootstrapped two projects with it
            and abandoned them. Just enough to know the basic concepts of how it
            works.
          </small>

          <b>TypeScript</b>
          <small>
            I am comfortable with it. Never got really deep with it. But never
            was also left hanging with it. I can get good use of utility types,
            type guards and template types where necessary.
          </small>

          <b>Node.js</b>
          <small>
            Fired up a few web backend projects with it, including one for
            production at Faraz Pajohan. Used Express, MySQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB,
            and Socket.IO with it.
          </small>

          <b>Express</b>
          <small>
            Not too advanced. Not too basic. Enough to launch a full RESTful API
            with it with enough complexity and still keep it clean!
          </small>

          <b>MongoDB</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge. Always loved it because it was easy ðŸ‘€
          </small>

          <b>HTML</b>
          <small>YES!</small>

          <b>CSS</b>
          <small>
            I always accomplished what I wanted with it without knowing how!
            Happens rarely recently. (I mean the "without knowing how" part)
          </small>

          <b>C++</b>
          <small>
            I've built a very basic 2D move and shoot game with SFML, wrote a
            network packet classifier with CUDA and modified a CGI web service
            written in C here and there.
          </small>

          <b>CUDA</b>
          <small>
            I know the concepts behind it, why and how this whole computing on
            GPU is cool and implemented a network packet classifier with CUDA.

            Angular/TypeScript, ExtJS -> React/MaterialUI -> TypeScript, Vue.js
            2 -> Vue.js 3. So I can say I can find my way in legacy code, deep
