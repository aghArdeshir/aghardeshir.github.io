              This is my first abroad job experience and the largest company
              size I've ever been to. The new things I learned here are huge
              project management using Lerna and how we had to keep the
              design/UI/UX stable across multiple products of the same company.
              And the challenge and strictness of the product's multilingualism
              here were far more serious than the internationalization
              experiences I had before. And also speaking English in the office
              was one of the best self-improvement skills I gained here. Plus,
              It is the most interesting product I've ever got to work on: A
              Website Builder!

              My main role here was Web-Application development, Front-end
              weighted. The main benefit of working at Faraz Pajohan is the
              expert people I get to work with and how teams are structured and
              managed & projects are planned. My best teamwork experience so far
              happened here and this is my first time bootstrapping and
              completing a professional-grade Web-Application from the ground
              up. Here I have the authority to devote time to applying best
              practices alongside developing features. So I get to contribute to
              different libraries we use and in the team, we pick tasks for
              cleaning up code and paying the technical debts periodically. What
              I am working on here is a Configuration Manager for a specific
              device. New things I enjoyed learning and getting done here are
              extreme use of WebSockets for real-time data, designing
              customizable dashboards, running and managing child processes from
              NodeJS, and running filterable/searchable/sortable/pageable SQL
              queries for backend and frontend. As the rest of the team were
              building a customized OS forked from Debian, I was responsible for
              installing and running the web application on it. So I got to
              config the NGINX, install InfluxDB, and run the NodeJS app and
              also serve the frontend SPA.

            There were two other jobs removed from here, because for both of
            them, I joined for the probabation period and left afterwards. One
            was a big one specialized in stock, trading and investment platforms
            and I worked on a product for future exchanges. The other one was a
            small company working on a manager app (docs + calendar + TODO list
            + etc...) and it was working on 3 native platforms: Web, Android and
            Windows. I was working on the Web. The reason I left the first one
            after the probabation period was lack of knowledgable people there
            (despite the company size, for which I met >50 developers
            everyday!). I did not see any potential for growth. And the reason I
            left the latter, despite the previous one I was surrounded by really
            genius people here, and I learned a lot even in those short ~1.5
            months. The problem though was the excessive working culture there.
            Working for 12 hours is OK if it happens from time to time, but do
            it everyday and it starts harming your life. Both of these ~1.5
            months experiences happened in 2019, between "Hasin" and "Faraz
            Pajohan".

              Freelancing on random web-related and a few C++/CUDA projects.
              Most notable ones were a full-featured frontend for a hotel in
              Hamedan. Including reservation, admin panel, payment, etc... And a
              network packet classifier using C++ and CUDA. It was an
              experimental project to understand if using GPUs in internet
              routers with CUDA could help us with classifying internet packets
              in real-time.

              Worked on various projects, mostly WordPress, and OpenCart. I
              mostly fixed PHP & JS Issues there + some HTML/CSS tweaks. I
              remember we created various online shops there and a couple
              websites for local businesses in Hamedan. Most satisfying
              experience I remember was this headphone shop, who asked us for a
              3D preview of headphones, which we could not create of course! But
              instead, we brought every headphone in, one by one, took pictures
              of it, and created a 360Â° preview on the website for which user
              could drag the mouse and rotate the headphone. We took ~30-40
              pictures of every headphone to show it most smooth while rotating.
              And I used a JQuery plugin to acoopmlish this for which I don't
              remember the name now.

        </h2>

        <div class="tools-and-skills">
          <b>JavaScript</b>
          <small>
            Confident enough to know I can build eveything I see with it
          </small>

          <b>DOM</b>
          <small>
            Know it and love it. I also love the challenge of re-implementing
            everythings that modern frameworks and UI libraries can do with pure
            DOM.
          </small>

          <b>React</b>
          <small>
            Have 4 years of full-time employed experience with it, and got
            pretty deep while working on a website builder
          </small>

          <b>Vue</b>
          <small>
            Had experience with it fro more than 1 year. Got enough knowledge
            with it while migrating a really complex project from Vue 2 to VUe
            3. One that involved communicating our declarative state to an
            imperative canvas library!
          </small>

          <b>AngularJS</b>
          <small>
            Worked for 2 full years with it, but don't remember much now.
            Specially it was the first years of my career. I did not look at
            things so much deep and conceptually back then.
          </small>

          <b>Angular</b>
          <small>
            Not much experience. Only a few months of professional experience.
            Angular was the one that taught me TypeScript. But after learning
            React and Vue, I always considered Angular as forcing us to
            over-structure the code-base. Sometimes we want quick and dirty
            while prototyping!
          </small>

          <b>Frontend E2E testing</b>
          <small> Have done a few. With CyPress and Selenium. </small>

          <b>NGINX</b>
          <small>
            I've fired up a few random personal projects on Linux VPSs. And were
            a full stack developer for one year at Faraz Pajohan and I set up
            the web application there.
          </small>

          <b>Linux Administration</b>
          <small>
            Very very basic knowledge! But enough to be able to turn a
            fresh-installed linux distro (does not matter what distro much) into
            a working web server. And enough to find my way around problems by
            searching for them online. My top-notch noticable experiences are
            building Ardour on my Ubuntu, and installing Arch linux following
            its documentation.
          </small>

          <b>RegEx</b>
          <small>
            Once I realized I know nothing about them, and went to HackerRank
            and solved A LOT of challenges. Now I am most comfortable with it.
            The best feeling is when a colleauge asks for help about it and I am
            able to help. ðŸ˜Ž
          </small>

          <b>Git</b>
          <small>
            I love Git. And I've used it almost everywhere I was (except a few
            months on a project I used SVN). I've been on GitHub, GitLab,
            ButBucket, and just Git servers! I do "rebase" instead of "merge"
            and I squash when necessary. I even resurrected "lost" work using
            <code>git reflog</code>.
          </small>

          <b>React Native</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge! Just have bootstrapped two projects with it
            and abandoned them. Just enough to know the basic concepts of how it
            works.
          </small>

          <b>TypeScript</b>
          <small>
            I am comfortable with it. Never got really deep with it. But never
            was also left hanging with it. I can get good use of utility types,
            type guards and template types where necessary.
          </small>

          <b>Node.js</b>
          <small>
            Fired up a few web backend projects with it, including one for
            production at Faraz Pajohan. Used Express, MySQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB,
            and Socket.IO with it.
          </small>

          <b>Express</b>
          <small>
            Not too advanced. Not too basic. Enough to launch a full RESTful API
            with it with enough complexity and still keep it clean!
          </small>

          <b>MongoDB</b>
          <small>
            Most basic knowledge. Always loved it because it was easy ðŸ‘€
          </small>

          <b>HTML</b>
          <small>YES!</small>

          <b>CSS</b>
          <small>
            I always accomplished what I wanted with it without knowing how!
            Happens rarely recently. (I mean the "without knowing how" part)
          </small>

          <b>C++</b>
          <small>
            I've built a very basic 2D move and shoot game with SFML, wrote a
            network packet classifier with CUDA and modified a CGI web service
            written in C here and there.
          </small>

          <b>CUDA</b>
          <small>
            I know the concepts behind it, why and how this whole computing on
            GPU is cool and implemented a network packet classifier with CUDA.

            I had quite experiences in transforming legacy code to new code. I
            migrated different projects from AngualarJS/JavaScript ->
            Angular/TypeScript, ExtJS -> React/MaterialUI -> TypeScript, Vue.js
            2 -> Vue.js 3. So I can say I can find my way in legacy code, deep
            dive in, and come out with a better code.

            I know my way in Audio: producing music, mixing and mastering and
